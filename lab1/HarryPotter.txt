Harry Potter is a tale so grand,  
Of wizards, wonders, and a destiny planned.  
With a lightning scar and courage untold,  
Harry’s journey through magic begins to unfold.

With friends beside him, he learns to rise.  
Facing fear, loss, and battles unknown,  
In the world of Harry Potter, magic is home.
